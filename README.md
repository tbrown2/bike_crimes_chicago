# Bike Theft in Chicago
For this project, I am to take data provided by the city of Chicago and produce some valuable information 

I am an avid biker, who recently had his bike seat stolen from him. I am going to look at cases of bike theft in the city of Chicago, and compare it to neighborhood data (socioeconomic information)

I will be looking at three specific questions:

1. Is there a relationship between the quantity of bike racks and bike theft per neighborhood? Are thieves likely to target areas with a greater quantity of bike racks (assumes that bike racks correlates with how many people are using bikes in neighborhood).
2. Is there a relationship between the income per capita and bike theft per neighborhood? Are wealthy neighborhoods or poorer neighborhoods affected by more theft?
3. Is there a relationship between income per capita and bike racks per neighborhood? Are wealthier neighborhoods more likely to have bike racks?
